# Better Pinterest Plugin

The better Pinterset plugin is designed to be as light weight as possible while achieving one goal: making it easy for your visitors to share your content on interest.

This plugin strives to achieve that goal with the following guidelines

- CSS will never use !important
- Minimal PHP manipulation to the page
- Using jQuery to manipulate the DOM to add any necessary markup
- Additional assets will load asyncronously to avoid any performance concerns
- The nopin="nopin" attribute will be explicitly respected. No questions asked
- The plugin will work on the current stock Wordpress themes and Genesis Framework (standard, no child theme)
- Instead of bloating the plugin  to support other themes we will use CSS and JS that a user is instructed to add to their theme
- Leave no footprint, when the plugin is deactivated it will remove all of it's options from the database

This plugin will be free and open-source. Developers are welcome to contribute after the first release of the plugin. Any issues and bug reports should be filed in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/terriann/betterpinterestplugin/issues) for the project and documentation will eventually live in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/terriann/betterpinterestplugin/wiki).

##What this Plugin will NOT do

I think it's important to define what this plugin will not do upfront.

This plugin will not...
- Have a way to verify your site for Pinterest  
 *Tip* Uploading the file to your root web directiory bypasses Wordpress in a smart & safe way that will alleviate stress on Wordpress for performance purposes
-  Ask for money or upsell a premium version
- Provide support on an individual basis   
  The developers will do their best to make this compatible with the most popular plugins and themes but will not copromise this plugin due to other developer's bad practices

##Plugin Description

A WordPress Pinterest sharing plugin. Perfect for DIY, craft, lifestyle &amp; photography blogs to promote your content easily with just the right bells &amp; whistles

What makes this a "better" Pinterest plugin? It's built by a web developer who crafts & blogs in her free time, that means she built this plugin to work for marketing Pinterst on her own products. Plus, it's free.  I could have charged $20 per download but I think open source code is neat and inspired by the fact that Pinterst open sources their stuff it seems like a good code gesture.

#Goals
